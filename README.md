# hid-google-stadiaff

This is a standalone/dkms build of the hid-google-stadiaff.ko kernel
driver.

Source is from the [v3 patch](https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-input/patch/20230709214410.3676224-1-fabiobaltieri@chromium.org/)

The code itself is as-is from the original submission. I have provided
the Makefile and dkms.conf.
